# SWE-bump-bench

## Overview

SWE-bump-bench is a benchmark for evaluating large language models on real world breaking-change dependency upgrade tasks collected from GitHub. Given a _codebase_, a _package_ to bump, and _package version_ to bump to, a language model is tasked with generating a patch that resolves any breaking changes for the upgrade.
